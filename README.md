# FuturesBacktestSystem
A back-testing system with custom strategies for futures based on pyAlgoTrade library.
Allows for easy strategy creation and testing by separating the strategy segment and the backtest segment. User can create multiple strategies based on entry and exit signals and pass that strategy into the backtest engine to get results or visualize trades.

**Users can:**

* Save trade signals
* Save key metrics and KPIs
* Save buy-sell signal plots
* Save cumulative plots (equity curves)
* read backtest results and evaluate seasonality across different contracts
